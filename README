by J. Bromley, S. Mironov

* Description

xkb-switch is a C++ program that allows to query and change the XKB layout state.
Originally ruby-based code written by J.Broomley.

XKeyboard.h    interface for a class that queries and sets XKB state (layouts)
XKeyboard.cpp  implementation for XKB query/set class
X11Exception.h C++ exception class
XKbSwitch.cpp  Main program
README         this file

The C++ class has no special dependencies on anything outside of
X-related libraries, so it can be easily used with other software.

* Building

To build the program manually, do the following.

 1. Unpack the tarball and cd to source directory
 2. cmake .
 3. make
 4. sudo make install


* Bugs or Problems

If you find any bugs please let me know at
ierton@gmail.com. Admittedly, I only tested with a few
different layouts that I used, so if you've got some odd layout or set
of layouts there may be problems. Please let me know.

Sergey.
